# An Exercise App

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This App is built to create awareness and improve knowledge on the different types of exercises like kegal exercise, meditation, differet food reccommendations for staying healthy and yoga. 

The App is built with modern app technologies such as dark mode, multi languages and calender notifications that the user sets based on carrying out their daily exercies as well as controlling their diet.

Another functionality embedded in the app is the platform to sign in with other social media details and save their app settings when they login to the same app on another mobile phone.
(STILL IN PROGRESS....)
